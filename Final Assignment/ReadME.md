## Objective
- To Explore and implement the techniques of class imbalance, specifically Oversampling and Undersampling Techniques
- To Asses the effect of the techniques to overall performance of the model, asssuming all other factors constant
- To provide a comparison bench mark for each techniques and overall between Undersamppling and Oversampling, which will be used in writing a paper "**A Comparative Analysis of the performance effect between OverSampling and Undersampling Techniques in solving class Imbalance in Machine Learning; A case Study of predicting building Insurace Claims**"
